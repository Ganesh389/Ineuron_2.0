1. What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and
parentheses?
Enclosing with square brackets results as an list comprehension.
Enclosing with parentheses results as a Generator Expression.

2. What is the relationship between generators and iterators?
Iterators are the objects that use the next() method to get the next value of the sequence. 
A generator is a function that produces or yields a sequence of values using a yield statement. 
Classes are used to Implement the iterators. Functions are used to implement the generator.

3. What are the signs that a function is a generator function?
A function with yield statements is a generator function.

4. What is the purpose of a yield statement?
The yield statement returns a generator object to the one who calls the function which contains yield, instead of simply returning a value.

5. What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and
contrast between the two.
List comprehension has a simpler configuration than the map function.  
List comprehension can be used together with if condition as replacement of filter method. 
Map function has no such functionality. However, we can feed the map function output to the filter function.  
List comprehension returns a list, whereas the map function returns an object of Iterable.  
List comprehension execution is faster than that of map function when the formula expression is huge and complex. 
Map function is faster than list comprehension when the formula is already defined as a function earlier. So, that map function is used without lambda expression.
